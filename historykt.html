<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,Segoe Script,Sans Serif;font-size:20"align="center">The Kalayaan Treewas then a young tree standing a few meters from the convent where Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo found temporary refuge. Revolutionary field officers waited under its shade to see the general and report on the battles won and lost by the revolutionaries. It was where Katipuneros waited for battle orders or military mission. Townspeople cheered Aguinaldo by this tree as he looked out the window or as he rode in his carriage on his way to the congress session at Barasoain Church
When Aguinaldo left Malolos, the convent headquarters- with all the important government papers—had to be burned. The Kalayaan tree was badly damaged but it has managed to survive.</p>
